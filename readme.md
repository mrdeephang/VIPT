# Visa Interview Prep App

### Description:

This project is my final submission for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python. This is a simple command-line program that helps practice for a visa interview. I made it because I wanted an easy way to run through common visa interview questions and see some model answers.The app comes with a few sample questions and answers in questions.json, but you can also add your own questions. It has a menu where you can pick to practice questions or add a new question. When you practice, it shows you questions one by one and then a suggested answer after you press Enter. The idea is you try to answer first, then see an example answer. The Visa Interview Prep App is a Python-based, command-line application designed to help users practice and prepare for visa interviews. This project was developed as the final submission for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python, and it represents a blend of simple user interaction, file handling, data management, and menu-based logic using Python’s built-in capabilities. The motivation behind this project stemmed from a personal need: to build confidence when answering common visa interview questions, especially for academic or travel-related purposes. Instead of relying on scattered information or videos, I wanted an interactive and customizable tool I could use anytime, even offline.

## Files

- visa_prep.py - the main Python program (reads questions, shows menu, etc).
- questions.json - the data file with interview questions and suggested answers.
- test_project.py - some basic test cases for the code.
- requirements.txt - lists any needed packages (only standard libraries are used here).
- script.txt - a short video presentation script about the project.

## Installation

You just need Python 3 to run this. No external libraries are required (everything uses Python’s built-in modules). If you use a virtual environment, you don’t need to install anything extra — the requirements.txt file is basically empty.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing these files.
3. Run the program with:
   python project.py
